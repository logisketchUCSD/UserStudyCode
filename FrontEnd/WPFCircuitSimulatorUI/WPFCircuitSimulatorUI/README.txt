Circuit Sketch is a program developed for simulating hand drawn sketches
of digital logic circuits using Tablet PCs.

How to use:
----------------------
1. Start up WPFCircuitSimulatorUI.exe. 
   Note: You may need to run as administrator if you installed it
         inside Program Files and are running Windows Vista or Windows 7.

2. Draw your digital circuit!

3. Hit the 'Recognize' button.

4. If your circuit is valid, hit the 'Simulate' button. If it's not valid,
   correct your circuit by using the hover widgets. To access these,
   simply hover your stylus in place over the screen for a few seconds.

5. Once your circuit is valid (you may need to hit 'Recognize' again), 
   enter simulation mode and toggle the inputs to see your circuit come
   to life!
