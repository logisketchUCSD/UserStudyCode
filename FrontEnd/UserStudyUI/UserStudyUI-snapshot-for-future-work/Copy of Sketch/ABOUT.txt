Sketch is a collection of classes used to represent a sketch.
By sketch, we are talking about a hand drawn figure, typically made on a
Tablet PC.

Sketch:
	consists of Strokes and Shapes
	plus attribute information specific to a Sketch
	
Stroke:
	consists of Substrokes
	plus attribute information specific to a Stroke
	
Shape:
	consists of Substrokes and Shapes
	knows about what it belongs to (parents)
	plus attribute information specific to a Shape
	
Substroke:
	consists of Points
	knows about what it belongs to (parents)
	plus attribute information specific to a Substroke
	
Point:
	plus attribute information specific to a Point
	

The main features of Sketch is that it allows Strokes and Substrokes to be split up.  
When something is split, the whole Sketch is transformed to reflect this split.
The Sketch also allows new labeled Shapes to be created.
