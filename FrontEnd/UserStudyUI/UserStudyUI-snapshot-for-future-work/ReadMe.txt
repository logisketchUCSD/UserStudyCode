UserStudyUI Snapshot with WoZ functionality turned off by default.

This version is a snapshot from Spring 2007 that includes dependencies (Labeler, Sketch, etc) 
that have undergone significant changes since UserStudyUI was last used for user studies.  This
version should run and be adequately modifiable should further testing need for any furture work.  

The relevant project file is UserStudyUI/UserStudyUI.sln
