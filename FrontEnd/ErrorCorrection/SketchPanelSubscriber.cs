    ///    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern
    /// A SketchPanelSubscriber serves as a base class for building Recognizers, Feedback Mechanisms, and 
    /// other modules that want to listen to SketchPanel events (e.g. sketching tools).
    /// 
    /// Lifecycle:
    ///    * On instantiation, call one of the constructors and use SubscribeToPanel() if necessary.
    ///    * Call UnsubscribeFromPanel() to disconnect this SketchPanelListener from 
    ///      SketchPanel events (stop listening).
    ///    * Call UnsubscribeFromPanel() before calling SketchPanel.InitPanel() or clearing SketchPanel
    ///      in any way that might destroy the event subscriptions contained within SketchPanel.  For 
    ///      example, if a SketchPanelListener subscribes to InkPicture events within a SketchPanel,
    ///      then deleting/reinitializing the InkPicture instance delete the SketchPanelListener's
    ///      event subscriptions in possibly unexpected ways.
    ///    * (Optional?) Call UnsubscribeFromPanel() before explicitely deleting SketchPanelListener.
