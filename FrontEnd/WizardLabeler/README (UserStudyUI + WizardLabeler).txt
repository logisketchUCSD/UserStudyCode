UserStudyUI + Wizard Labeler
----------------------------

UserStudyUI is a skeleton sketch user interface designed for doing 
User Studies of Recognition Triggers, Feedback Mechanisms, Annotation 
Tools, and Error Types.  This code is currently not maintained but 
serves as an example of how to build a sketch UI atop INK that 
supports the interface elements tested in the study.  All useful 
knowledge gained while completing this study has been applied while 
building the SketchPanel and InkSketch framework; please reference 
those code bases rather than this one when building new projects.  To 
use the UserStudyUI, start up the program and use the Dev menu to
switch between elements.  

WizardLabeler is a modified version of the Old Labeler used for doing
Wizard of Oz studies (of Feedback Mechanisms and Error Types).  This 
version of the labeler contains network code to transfer sketch data 
between the Labeler and UserStudyUI.

This code was used to support the "Building a Sketch Recognition Front-End" 
paper located in the /Papers/2006-7 directory.
