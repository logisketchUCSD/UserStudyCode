ConverterJNT is the collection of classes that enables the following conversions:

Journal file	--> Sketch			(facilitated through ReadInk)
Sketch			--> Journal file	(facilitated through MakeInk) 

XML represents an XML document developed at MIT that specifically stores information about a 
sketch.  By sketch, we are talking about a hand drawn figure, typically made on a Tablet PC.

The conversion Journal1 --> Sketch --> Journal2 is not lossless.  
The Sketch --> Journal is only for creating an oInk object that can be displayed.
