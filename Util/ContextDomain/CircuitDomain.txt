# Circuit Connectivity Description File
# This file explains how things are allowed to be connected in a
# circuit sketch. Here's how to read it:
#    [class] [type] [#] [+/-/E] [other class] [#] [+/-/E] [other class] ...
#
# So for example:
#
#    Wire Wire 2 + Gate 0 + Text 0 E Wire
#              \______/ \______/ \______/
#
# means that one way for wires to be correctly connected is for them
# to be connected to 2 or more gates, 0 or more text labels, and exactly
# zero wires.
#
# The parser for this file (see ContextDomain.CircuitDomain) ignores 
# empty lines and lines that start with a '#'.
